Quarantine,"Trump Attacks His Own Supporters for Not Endorsing His COVID-19 Vaccines – Republicans ""Opposing"" Vaccine Mandates Own Stock in Pfizer, Moderna, J&J  In an effort to obviously continue the blockbuster sales of COVID-19 shots and get more people to take the booster shots since the original doses no longer work, Anthony Fauci was interviewed on CNBC this weekend and stated that he wanted the definition of ""vaccinated"" to now mean only those people who have been injected with the original doses, and the current booster shot.  This would, of course, swell the number of people in the United States considered ""unvaccinated"" considerably, just after news reports surfaced over the weekend that the CDC had ""underestimated"" the number of unvaccinated people in the U.S. by ""millions.""  President Trump also appeared in public this weekend with Bill O'Reilly to help Big Pharma push their booster shots, declaring, along with Bill O'Reilly, that he was fully vaccinated and had received his booster shot.  He pleaded with his supporters to join him in ""taking credit"" for rolling out the COVID-19 shots in 2020, and stated that those who did not agree with his position on the COVID-19 shots were ""playing right into their hands"" by letting the Democrats and the Biden Administration take all the credit for them.  When Trump asked his audience if they agreed with him, which would be basically asking them to ""take credit"" for what is now tens of thousands of deaths and nearly 1 million adverse events following the COVID-19 shots, which is more deaths and injuries than following all FDA-approved vaccines for the past 31 years, the crowd cheered.  When he announced that he had taken a COVID-19 booster shot, you can hear some boos in the background, which drew the ire of the former President who tried to belittle them by stating that they were just a ""tiny group"" who did not agree with him.  Trump seemingly is able to maintain this cult-like following from even those who consider themselves anti-vaxxers by always throwing in the phrase ""but it should be your choice, they should not be mandated,"" which then somehow makes his position on the bioweapons killing and maiming people OK with his followers.  This is the great deception that is currently being used by the Republican Party to try and make themselves look like they are opposed to Big Pharma: just oppose the vaccine mandates.  However, a recent report published by Business Insider reveals that many Republican lawmakers who state they oppose vaccine ""mandates"" actually own stock in the pharmaceutical companies producing the vaccines, and are profiting from them. – Infinite Unknown","At least 11 senators and 34 representatives also held shares in 2020 of another COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer, Pfizer.
