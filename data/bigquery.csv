And later that afternoon, researchers in Australia said they'd come up with a treatment, based on previous effort to make a vaccine against SARS, which could potentially work.

When he announced that he had taken a COVID-19 booster shot, you can hear some boos in the background, which drew the ire of the former President who tried to belittle them by stating that they were just a ""tiny group"" who did not agree with him.  Trump seemingly is able to maintain this cult-like following from even those who consider themselves anti-vaxxers by always throwing in the phrase ""but it should be your choice, they should not be mandated,"" which then somehow makes his position on the bioweapons killing and maiming people OK with his followers.

For decades, vaccines have been used as the main public health weapon to eliminate or reduce the risk of complications leading to death, as well as to reduce hospital costs, thus proving to be the most cost-effective and cost-beneficial intervention. 4 The success of this strategy depends largely on the effectiveness of the vaccines and the level of acceptance by the population, which enables the attainment of herd immunity through direct protection. 5 Therefore, in any disease the succe",1,3
